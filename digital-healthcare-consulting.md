  - title: Decentralised Digital Healthcare Consulting
    content: |
      The convergence of technology and data is propelling us into an era of instant access to information. Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to broaden the realm of possibilities for purpose-based and insights-based services in the Health sector. “Data” is the life-blood behind new Quality of Life (QOL) advancements, bringing a deeper level of insight, knowledge, and value to Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical companies, healthcare professionals, and, most importantly, the patients themselves. Further fuelled by a growing mistrust in information technologies, we are witnessing the birth of a decentralisation movement where encrypted pairwise communication channels will ensure that Protected Health Information (PHI) is only accessible to intended recipients. These trusted relationships throughout the healthcare system will ultimately empower a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE).

      **What we do**
      Our team of experts cover the decentralisation aspects of the three core data domains of Semantic, Inputs, and Governance\:
    sublist:
      - content: "The core DDE principles for the Semantic domain are an extension of the FAIR Principles, a set of guidelines to improve the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital objects. When the overall accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data objects and their relationships are deterministic, **objectual integrity** is achieved."
      - content: "The core DDE principles for the Inputs domain are an extension of the Principles of SSI, a set of guidelines intended to bring the highest level of event assurance to any digital authentication system to protect trust and foster a sense of safety and security among end-users. When the origin, accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data, including what happens to it and where it moves, is verifiable, **factual authenticity** is achieved."
      - content: "The core DDE principles for the Governance domain are an extension of the European Data Governance Act, a legislative proposal of the European Commission that aims to create a rules framework to facilitate data-sharing. Data veracity is how accurate or truthful the data is, including data quality and how trustworthy the data source, type, and processing are. When agreed by consensus, **consensual veracity** is achieved."
