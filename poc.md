      Meaningful change never comes without a bold first step. While healthcare organisations and startups alike should be open to innovation, identifying and planning for potential issues upfront goes a long way toward preventing excessive expenditure and unnecessary risk to patients' lives. Although an unsuccessful pilot is nobody's first choice, it gives organisations a chance to address their shortcomings and improve their next attempt. Innovation is inherently risky, so why introduce additional risk by changing your process every time you try to innovate?

      Current systems lead to centralisation and one-stop shops, which is unnatural and unrealistic in terms of human interactions in the physical space. We need new approaches to overcome these challenges at the infrastructure level to keep a fair, competitive market for big and small entrepreneurs and to ensure safe and privacy-preserved methods for customers operating in the digital space.

      Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) focuses on accurate and authentic data flows, which address all the above problems, keeping patients and healthcare professionals at the centre of all digital interactions. There is no pilot too ambitious or disruptive to current business models that MeDDEa will shy away from.
