      The life science industry is interested in using “Real-World Data” (RWD) for improved sectoral insights to improve the quality of life for patients and is currently pioneering its integration into experimental and regulatory pipelines. However, regulatory requirements drive the development and approval of drugs, treatments, and therapies; therefore, RWD transformation is risky and costly.

      Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) enables seamless data transformation from one format or structure to another, such as raw data to processed or unstructured to structured, providing interoperable forms to map legacy data to standard capture bases. In addition, the task-oriented overlays provide the necessary underpinning for structured criteria searches on dynamic data sharing engines, making data more widely accessible by opening up high-value datasets across jurisdictions.

      Enabling data sharing and reuse in a Dynamic Data Economy (DDE) supports clinical evidence regarding the use and potential benefits or risks of new drugs, treatments, and therapies outside the context of prescriptive randomised clinical trials (RCTs).
